# Claude Resume Checklist

Read this file immediately when resuming after context compression.

## Task Tracking with TodoWrite

**ALWAYS use TodoWrite** to track tasks during multi-step work:

1. Create a todo list at the start of any non-trivial task
2. Mark tasks `in_progress` when starting them
3. Mark tasks `completed` immediately when done (don't batch)
4. Update the list as new tasks are discovered
5. Check the todo list after context compression to see what's already done

This prevents duplicate work and maintains accurate state across sessions.

## Pattern to ALWAYS Follow

When adding ANY linter/type suppression (`# noqa`, `# type: ignore`,
`<!-- markdownlint-disable -->`), IMMEDIATELY add an explanatory comment:

```python
# noqa: E501 - reason why this line must be long
# type: ignore[arg-type] - reason for ignoring type error
```

```markdown
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
<!-- MD013: reason for allowing long lines -->
```

A pre-commit hook will reject commits missing these explanations.

## Critical: Re-read These Files First

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Contains all project constraints and coding standards
2. **Plan file** (if mentioned in context) - Contains implementation details

## Key Constraints (from CLAUDE.md)

### Code Style

- NO bare functions - all code must be methods of classes or local to a method
- Exception: single `main()` in `__main__.py`
- All source files MUST have standard header blocks (see CLAUDE.md for format)
- Schemas and data files must be bundled as package resources

### File Headers Required

Python files need this header format:

```python
##############################################################################
#
# Name: filename.py
#
# Function:
#       Brief description
#
# Copyright notice and license:
#       See LICENSE.md
#
# Author:
#       Terry Moore
#
##############################################################################
```

### Build and Test

- Use `uv` for project/dependency management
- Use `pytest` for testing - all classes need unit tests
- Run `uv run ruff check src tests` before commits
- Run `npx markdownlint <file.md>` on all markdown files

### Markdown Rules

- All .md files must pass markdownlint
- Ask user before adding markdownlint disable annotations
- Use save/restore pattern for local disables
- **IMPORTANT**: When adding markdownlint-disable, MUST add comment lines
  explaining each rule on separate lines after the disable directive:
  ```
  <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD041 -->
  <!-- MD013: reason for disabling -->
  <!-- MD041: reason for disabling -->
  ```

### Dependency Versioning

- Packages 1.0+: Use `"package>=X.Y, ==X.*"`
- Packages <1.0: Lock to minor version `"package>=0.X.0, ==0.X.*"`

### File Locations

- NEVER write to installation/source directory
- Outputs go to: user config directory OR task directory

### Option Priority

- JSON file options > Command line > Defaults

## Before Committing

1. Run: `uv run ruff check src tests`
2. Run: `uv run pytest`
3. Run: `npx markdownlint` on any changed .md files
4. Verify file headers on new files
5. Follow commit message format with emoji and co-author

## Current Project State

This is the meetup-scheduler project. Key implemented features:
- CLI with commands: init, config, login, logout, sync, schedule, generate, readme
- OAuth authentication with Meetup API
- Event scheduling from JSON files
- Recurrence pattern generation
